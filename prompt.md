Im studying for my microsoft azure certification (az900) and I feel there is too much unecessary information to read in the read-related classes.
I would like your help to properly summarize those read-related classes for me in a way that I can build a summary (where I can consult later IF it is important to the exam) and memorize what is the most important (such as resources names, what they do, key config fields, and here a may need your help since your probably know the contents of the exam).
You can maybe even prepare a bunch of exam questions every time I change from a resource/classs or theme.

Are you ready for the first read-related class?
