# Azure Policy initiatives

**Azure main governance tool = Azure Policy**

Azure Policy is a service that allows you to create, assign, and manage governance policies that enforce rules and effects over Azure resources to ensure that they stay compliant with your IT governance standards.
These policies enforce various rules and effects on resources, ensuring that they adhere to corporate standards and service-level agreements.

**Will learn to**
- Assign a policy to enforce a condition for resources you create in the future
- Create and assign an initiative definition to track compliance for multiple resources
- Resolve a noncompliant or denied resource
- Implement a new policy across an organization

**Cloud Adoption Framework for Azure** - offers comprehensive technical guidance for Microsoft Azure. 
**Cloud governance** refers to the **management of cloud usage in your organization**. 

Cloud Adoption Framework - **Govern methodology** 
- offers a systematic **framework for setting up and improving cloud governance in Azure**. 
- addresses crucial areas, such as regulatory compliance, security, operations, cost management, data, resource management, and AI
- essential for defining and maintaining efficient cloud use
- divides cloud governance into five steps

1. Build a governance team 
2. Assess cloud risks
3. Document cloud governance policies
4. Enforce cloud governance policies
5. Monitor cloud governance

Key considerations when defining a corporate cloud governance policy
- Business risk – You must document the evolving business risks and the business's tolerance for risk based on data classification and application criticality.
- Policy and compliance – You must convert risk decisions into policy statements to establish cloud adoption boundaries efficiently.
- Process – You must establish processes to monitor violations and adherence to corporate policies.

Five core disciplines of cloud governance
1. Cost management
2. Secutiry Guidelines - Ensures compliance with IT security requirements by applying a security baseline to all adoption efforts.
3. Resource consistency - Ensures consistency in resource configuration and enforcing practices for onboarding, recovery, and discoverability.
4. Identity baseline - Ensures that the baseline for identity and access is enforced by consistently applying role definitions and assignments.
5. Deployment acceleration

Levels of management to establish proper governance
- Management groups - **Azure management groups provide a level of scope above subscriptions. If you have many subscriptions, you might need a way to efficiently manage access, policies, and compliance for those subscriptions**
- Subscriptions - unit of management, billing, and scale
- Resource groups - groupings of resources
- Resources - basic building block of Azure

## Azure Resource Manager
Azure Resource Manager is the deployment and management service for Azure. It provides a management layer that allows you to create, update, and delete resources in your Azure account.

Azure operations are classified into two main types: 
- control plane - helps you manage resources in your subscription
- data plane - allows you to access the capabilities provided by instances of specific resource types

### Control Plane
- **Azure Policy operates in the control plane** to **enforce rules and compliance on your resources** 
- **Azure Resource Manager manages all control plane operations** in Azure and includes the different components that are centralized between the different services. 
- **Azure Policy is integrated with Azure Resource Manager**

Functions
- template-based deployments
- role-based access control (RBAC)
- auditing
- monitoring
- tagging - unified management experience for Azure resources after deployment

*You send requests to Control plane through any of the Azure APIs, tools, or SDKs and Azure Resource Manager receives the request*

### Data Plane
- where the actual data operations occur, and Azure Policy ensures that the resources you interact with in the data plane are compliant with your policies
- operations involve direct interaction with the data stored in a resource
- each Azure service handles these requests internally, bypassing Azure Resource Manager, and directly managing the data through its resource provider
- Service-specific access controls, such as RBAC or access control lists (ACLs), often manage data plane permissions
- The service responds with the data or result of the data operation, ensuring that the requester has the correct permissions

## Azure Policy resources
- Azure Policy enforces organizational standards and assesses compliance at scale
- evaluates Azure resources and actions by comparing their properties to business rules
- allows for detailed analysis down to each resource and policy level with granularity

Six policy resources are available in Azure
1. Definitions - describe resource compliance conditions and the effect to take if a condition is met under a scope (any scope: RG, MG, resources, subscriptions)
2. Initiatives - also known as a policy set, allow you to group several policy definitions to simplify assignments and management because you work with the initiatives as a single item
  - multiple tagging policy definitions can be grouped into a single initiative and this initiative can be applied in a resource instead of applying each policy individually
3. Assignments - define which resources are evaluated by a policy definition or initiative
4. Exemptions - feature to exempt a resource hierarchy or an individual resource from evaluation of initiatives or definitions
5. Attestations - set compliance states of resources or scopes targeted by manual policies
  - Each applicable resource requires one attestation for each manual policy assignment
  - manual policies should be designed to target the scope that defines the boundary of resources whose compliance state needs to be attested
6. Remediations - bring resources into compliance based on a definition and assignment
  - Resources that are noncompliant to a modify or deployIfNotExists definition assignment can be brought into compliance by using a remediation task
