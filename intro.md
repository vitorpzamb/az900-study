# AZ-900 Cloud Concepts Summarxy

## Overview

Cloud Concepts cover the foundational principles of cloud computing, including its benefits, deployment models, and service models. This section is critical for the AZ-900 exam, as it forms the basis for understanding Azure’s value proposition and architecture. Expect questions on definitions, benefits, and comparisons of cloud models.
*Scalability focuses on the ability to handle increased workloads by expanding resources, while elasticity focuses on automatically adjusting resources based on real-time demand fluctuations. *

## Key Concepts

1. **Definition of Cloud Computing**:

   - Cloud computing involves delivering computing services (servers, storage, databases, networking, software) over the internet, offering on-demand resource provisioning, scalability, and elasticity.
   - Key characteristics: On-demand self-service, broad network access, resource pooling, rapid elasticity, and measured service (pay-as-you-go).

2. **Benefits of Cloud Computing**:

   - **High Availability**: Ensures services are accessible with minimal downtime through redundancy and failover mechanisms.
   - **Scalability**: Ability to scale resources up or down based on demand (vertical scaling: increase resource capacity; horizontal scaling: add more instances).
   - **Elasticity**: Automatically adjusts resources to match workload changes, optimizing costs.
   - **Agility**: Rapid deployment and iteration of applications and services.
   - **Disaster Recovery**: Data backup and recovery mechanisms to ensure business continuity.
   - **Cost Efficiency**: Pay only for what you use (consumption-based model), reducing upfront capital expenditure (CapEx) compared to on-premises infrastructure.

3. **Cloud Deployment Models**:

   - **Public Cloud**: Resources owned and operated by a provider (e.g., Azure) and shared across multiple organizations. Offers scalability and cost efficiency but less control.
   - **Private Cloud**: Dedicated resources for a single organization, offering greater control and security but higher costs.
   - **Hybrid Cloud**: Combines public and private clouds, allowing data and applications to move between them for flexibility and optimization.
   - **Community Cloud**: Shared infrastructure for specific communities with common concerns (e.g., security, compliance).

4. **Cloud Service Models**:

   - **Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS)**: Provides virtualized computing resources (e.g., VMs, storage, networks). Example: Azure Virtual Machines. You manage the OS and applications.
   - **Platform as a Service (PaaS)**: Provides a platform for developing and deploying applications without managing underlying infrastructure. Example: Azure App Service. You focus on code, not servers.
   - **Software as a Service (SaaS)**: Fully managed software accessed via the internet. Example: Microsoft 365. You use the software; the provider handles everything else.
   - **Serverless Computing**: A subset of PaaS where you write code (e.g., Azure Functions) and the provider manages scaling and infrastructure dynamically.

5. **Key Azure Resources Related to Cloud Concepts**:

   - **Azure Virtual Machines (IaaS)**: Virtualized servers for running applications. Key config fields: VM size (CPU/memory), OS disk, region, availability set/zone.
   - **Azure App Service (PaaS)**: Platform for hosting web apps, APIs, or mobile backends. Key config fields: App Service plan (pricing tier), runtime stack, custom domain.
   - **Azure Functions (Serverless)**: Event-driven compute for running code without managing servers. Key config fields: Trigger type (e.g., HTTP, timer), runtime, scaling settings.
   - **Azure Active Directory (SaaS-like for identity)**: Manages user identities and access. Key config fields: Tenant ID, user roles, authentication methods.

## Memorization Tips

- **Focus on Benefits**: Memorize the key benefits (high availability, scalability, elasticity, agility, disaster recovery, cost efficiency) and link them to real-world scenarios (e.g., scaling for traffic spikes).
- **Know the Models**: Be able to compare public, private, hybrid, and community clouds, and IaaS, PaaS, SaaS, and serverless. Use acronyms (e.g., “I Pick Strawberries” for IaaS, PaaS, SaaS).
- **Understand Resource Purposes**:
  - Azure Virtual Machines: Flexible compute for custom workloads.
  - Azure App Service: Quick deployment of web apps.
  - Azure Functions: Event-driven, cost-effective automation.
  - Azure Active Directory: Identity and access management.
- **Key Config Fields**: Focus on what defines a resource’s setup (e.g., VM size for Virtual Machines, pricing tier for App Service).

## Sample Exam Questions

1. **Question**: What is a key benefit of cloud computing that allows a company to pay only for the resources it uses?

   - A. High availability
   - B. Scalability
   - C. Elasticity
   - D. Cost efficiency
   - **Answer**: D. Cost efficiency
   - **Explanation**: The consumption-based model of cloud computing allows companies to pay only for resources used, reducing costs compared to traditional on-premises setups.

2. **Question**: A company wants to run a legacy application requiring specialized hardware on-premises while using Azure for new applications. Which cloud deployment model is best suited?

   - A. Public cloud
   - B. Private cloud
   - C. Hybrid cloud
   - D. Community cloud
   - **Answer**: C. Hybrid cloud
   - **Explanation**: A hybrid cloud combines on-premises (private) and public cloud resources, allowing legacy applications to stay on-premises while new applications leverage Azure’s scalability.

3. **Question**: Which Azure service is an example of Platform as a Service (PaaS)?

   - A. Azure Virtual Machines
   - B. Azure App Service
   - C. Microsoft 365
   - D. Azure Blob Storage
   - **Answer**: B. Azure App Service
   - **Explanation**: Azure App Service allows developers to deploy web applications without managing underlying infrastructure, characteristic of PaaS.

4. **Question**: What is a key configuration field for Azure Virtual Machines?

   - A. Trigger type
   - B. VM size
   - C. Pricing tier
   - D. Tenant ID
   - **Answer**: B. VM size
   - **Explanation**: VM size determines the CPU, memory, and performance of an Azure Virtual Machine, a critical configuration field.

5. **Question**: Which cloud service model requires the least management of underlying infrastructure by the user?

   - A. IaaS
   - B. PaaS
   - C. SaaS
   - D. Serverless
   - **Answer**: C. SaaS
   - **Explanation**: SaaS provides fully managed software, requiring no infrastructure management by the user, unlike IaaS, PaaS, or serverless.
